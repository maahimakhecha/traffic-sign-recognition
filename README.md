# Traffic Sign Recognition System

This project implements a Traffic Sign Recognition System using supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Decision Tree) in Python. The system analyzes traffic sign data and compares the performance of two classifiers.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Feature scaling
- Model training using Random Forest and Decision Tree
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix)
- Data visualization

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- jupyter (for running the notebook)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
   ```
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook traffic_sign_recognition.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells in order to reproduce the results.

## Project Structure
- `traffic_sign_recognition.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
- `Meta.csv`: (Not included) The CSV file with traffic sign metadata used in the notebook. Please add your own dataset as needed.
